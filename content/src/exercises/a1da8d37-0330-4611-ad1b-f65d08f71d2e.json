    "description": "Sometimes, it can be challenging at first to offer the same compassionate response to ourselves as we do to our friends. Self-compassion is when we show kindness and compassion to ourselves in the same way we do for others. Like we did for our friends, we can offer ourselves kindness or time to practice self-care. We can use positive self-talk. We can catch ourselves when we fall into thinking traps or take time to look at our situation from a broader perspective. Doing so can help us find ways to shift what we’re thinking and take steps to feel better."
