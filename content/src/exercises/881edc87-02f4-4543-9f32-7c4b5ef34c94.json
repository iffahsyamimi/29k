    "description": "Developing an ability to watch thought processes in the mind is a great way to catch thinking traps. Sometimes when we are experiencing distressing thoughts or challenging feelings, we might feel that there is no space or time to choose a more constructive way to deal with the challenge. Our ideas or feelings could be so intense, paralyzing or compelling that it seems to us we have no choice to think, feel, or aCT DIFFERENTLY/ We do often have more choice than that, however. We can pause to remember: “I do not have to act on each emotional impulse or thought. I can navigate emotional experiences in healthy ways, to the benefit of myself and others.\""
